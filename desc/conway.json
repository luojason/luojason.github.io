			"The Game of Life is a 2d cellular automaton, where each cell is either 'alive' or 'dead'. At each tick, the new state of a given cell is determined by the current states of its neighbours (ie adjacent cells). In this implementation, borders wrap around (such that the grid is like a torus).",
			"If a living cell has 2 or 3 living neighbours, it remains alive in the next generation; otherwise, it dies. On the other hand, if a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbours, it will become live in the next generation."
